<h3>Separating Concerns</h3>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>
The entire exterior appearance of an organization is shown here,
and its communication with its public.
</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>

The entire way an organization deals with its customers is encompassed here. It 
It is "the business office" or "the back room", and what goes on here is of
necessity not exosed to the public.
</p>
<h2>Persistence</h2>
<p>
What is in this tier is the entire legal record of the organization. The content
is not only to be protcted from disclosure, but especially from modification,
and this protection from modifiction may need to extend even to members of the
staff.
