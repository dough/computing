<p>When we think about the work of an organization that involves data processing it can be convenient to separate it out so that we can focus on one aspect at a time. Of course we are doing processing of data, but where does the data come from and where does it go, and how do we process it?</p>
<h2 id="customers">Customers</h2>
<p>Surely we intend to have customers? They have to be handled carefully, openly, and appropriately. There will be all sorts of ways to communicate with them: at least</p>
<p>– in person – through the web – through email</p>
<h2 id="suppliers">Suppliers</h2>
<p>We are certainly going to sell something? and buy something? Suppliers have their own methods and forms, and while we don’t necessarily have to humor them we dp have to honor them, and observe whatever formalities they require or desire.</p>
<h2 id="authorities">Authorities</h2>
<p>I think businesses tend to have licenses? And pay taxes? And deal with building inspectors? If we do not handle these matters very precisely following exactimg time constraints we are doomed.</p>
<p>This is getting complicated! Also in dealing with customers especially we need to be outward-facing, on the other hand our records should probably not be exposed at all to the outside, except through properly and carefully prepared reports that we may issue, and those are not issued to the public, but specifically only to certain outsiders.</p>
<h2 id="separation-of-concerns">Separation of Concerns</h2>
<p>Separation of concerns to the rescue! And <strong>Triple-P</strong>: from now on just <strong>PPP</strong>. It stands for <em>Presentation</em>:<em>Processing</em>:<em>Persistence</em>.</p>
<p>###Presentation: front office</p>
<p>The entire exterior appearance of an organization is shown here, and its communication with its public. This is the <em>front office</em>.</p>
<h3 id="processing-back-office">Processing: back office</h3>
<p>The entire way an organization deals with its customers is encompassed here. It is <em>the business office</em> or <em>the back room</em>, and what goes on here is of necessity not exosed to the public. From here we may communicate with suppliers and authorities, and not expose those communications to the public.</p>
<h3 id="persistence-vault">Persistence: vault</h3>
<p>What is in this tier is the entire legal record of the organization. The content is not only to be protcted from disclosure, but especially from modification, and this protection from modifiction may need to extend even to members of the staff. It is <em>the vault</em>.</p>
