<p>Communications Languages</p>
<p>We are going to want to build and then operate communicatons systems, and before we do (it’s best done before!) to design them and later to describe them as far as their purpose and how it will be achieved. Although with an actual network it should be designed before it is built, and the design should be tempered by the way we will operate it, in fact before you can design you need to have a notion of what will be available to build with, and what will be possible in operating.</p>
<p>So let’s start with four simple concepts called <em>Push,Pipe,Pull,Pump</em> that describe communicating. You could <em>push</em> information in, and expect it to be <em>pull</em>ed out; or you could deal with information that has been pushed into a <em>pipe</em>, and expects to be pulled out. Thus <strong>Pipe</strong> will model storage, and <strong>Push</strong> will model getting information to it.</p>
<p>Now that we have a notion of how information could get into a system, we think about getting it out by a <strong>Pull</strong> (from storage or from upstream, that is from a Push or a Pipe), preparatory to sending it along, or we could use a <strong>Pump</strong> to pull it in, do something with it, and then push it out.</p>
<p>Doing a small bit of thinking about those four ideas we notice that one, the <strong>Pipe</strong>, is fully <em>passive</em>, some other component will have to be responsible for moving the information, while another, the <strong>Pump</strong>, is fully <em>active</em>, taking responsibility for the information on both ends. The other two components, the Push and the Pull, are really just to extend the reach of the first two. In fact the Push and the Pull, conceptually are made from the other two. A Push looks conceptually like a Pull followed by a Pump ,except that it does not have a motive force inside; and a Pull looks conceptually like a Pump followed by a Pipe, except for the lack of a motive force inside.</p>
<p>This tells us that we really are only going to need pumps and pipes to build our system, and then we can think about which parts will be active and which passive when we think about operating the network. Before devising a <strong>Build</strong> language, which surely will be very complex, one more step might help us remember the components: write <strong>HELP</strong>, and notice that the four letters are the last letters of the four major components <em>Push:Pipe:Pull:Pump</em>!</p>
<p>If you are ready, remember that to construct a written language you typically give the <em>alphabet</em>, the <em>words</em>, which are a selection of strings from the alphabet, and sentences, which are a selection of ways words can be put together into sentences. It is very complicated.</p>
<p>Our alphabet will consist of two letters p and e; the syntax rules are very simple - the letters must alternate. We are done. Lets write two complex phrases to see how it goes: lets write <em>pep</em> and <em>epe</em>.</p>
<p>Its pretty easy to write a composition of any length: just start by writing either <em>p</em> or <em>e</em>, and then the composition writes itself, and you go until the desired length is reached (or you run out of time, or patience, or letters). Not very hard to use this language, and there are only two sentences of any particular lenght, determined by the first letter!</p>
<p>Oh, what about words? Well if you insist on these there are exactly four possible: <strong>h</strong>, <strong>e</strong>, <strong>l</strong>, and <strong>p</strong>. Its kind of easy to think this way, but you may not be used to the fact that the grammar is already determined only by the letters used, and you can think afterwards about what the author might have had in mind.</p>
<p>For example I write epepe. I might have meant exactly that; or maybe I meant lle, or could I have intended ehh! Oh, this grammar is simple, but it is ambiguous!</p>
<p>That models communications very closely; you can build a means of communication, and learn that it can be described and even used in ways you did not anticipate. The language we have just learned, fully, could be named perhaps <strong>EPEP</strong> or <strong>PEPE</strong>. If you want to think about meaning, and so bring in extensions, maybe just call for <strong>HELP</strong>.</p>
