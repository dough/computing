<p>The Communications Language PEPE # Introduction</p>
<p>Four simple concepts called <strong>Push,Pipe,Pull,Pump</strong> describe communications components. Lets give a first person description of what the component sees.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>push</em> along information that is pushed to you.</li>
<li>You can <em>push</em> information into a <strong>Pipe</strong>, expecting it to be <em>pull</em>ed out.</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong> models sending information.</li>
<li><p><strong>Pipe</strong> models storing information.</p></li>
<li>You can <em>pull</em> information out, expecting it to have been provided.</li>
<li>You can <em>pull</em> information in, process it(maybe by leaving it alone), and <em>push</em> the result out.</li>
<li><strong>Pull</strong> models receiving information.</li>
<li><p><strong>Pump</strong> models processing information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Doing a small bit of thinking about those four ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Pipe</strong>, is fully <em>passive</em>, some other component will have to be responsible for moving the information</li>
<li><p>the <strong>Pump</strong> is ully <em>active</em>, having total responsibility for information handling.</p></li>
<li>The <strong>Push</strong> and the <strong>Pull</strong> extend the reach of the first two.</li>
<li><p>This pair can be viewed conceptually as made from the other pair.</p></li>
<li>Push looks like Pull followed by Pump (except it does not have a motive force inside).</li>
<li><p>Pull looks like Pump followed by Pipe (except for the lack of a motive force inside).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This tells us that we are only going to need <em>pump</em>s and <em>pipe</em>s to build a system, and then think about which parts will need to be active and which passive when operating the system.</p>
<p>Before devising a BUILD language, which surely will be very complex, it might might HELP to list the components in the right order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pus<strong>h</strong></li>
<li>Pip<strong>e</strong></li>
<li>Pul<strong>l</strong></li>
<li>Pum<strong>p</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ready, remember that to construct a written language you typically give the <em>alphabet</em>, a dictionary of the <em>words</em>, which are a selection of strings from the alphabet, and a <em>grammar</em> which shows the syntax for sentences. It is very complicated.</p>
<h1 id="tne-alphabet-dictionary-and-grammar-for-pepe">Tne alphabet, dictionary, and grammar for PEPE</h1>
<h2 id="alphabet-p-e"><em>alphabet</em> <strong>p</strong>, <strong>e</strong></h2>
<h2 id="grammar-the-letters-must-alternate."><em>grammar</em> <strong>the letters must alternate</strong>.</h2>
<p>You now know the entire language.</p>
<h1 id="samples-of-pepe-writing">Samples of PEPE writing</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>pep</em></li>
<li><em>epe</em></li>
<li><em>pepe</em></li>
<li><em>epepepe</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="style-guide-for-pepe">Style guide for PEPE</h2>
<p>Its easy to write a composition of any length:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin with either <em>p</em> or <em>e</em> and the grammar wtakes over.</li>
<li>Stop when you have the desired length; or you run out of time, or patience, or letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not very hard to use this language, as there are only two sentences of any particular length, determined by the first letter!</p>
<h2 id="meaning-in-pepe">Meaning in PEPE</h2>
<p>Oh, I forgot the <em>dictionary</em>:</p>
<p>There are four words:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>h</strong> spelled <em>ep</em>, meaning you are Push-ing to them.</li>
<li><strong>e</strong> spelled <em>e</em>, meaning you will just be used (as a Pipe).</li>
<li><strong>l</strong> spelled <em>pe</em>, meaning they are Pull-ing from you.</li>
<li><strong>p</strong> spelled <em>p</em>, meaning you (as a Pump) are going to process something</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not be used to the fact that the grammar is already determined by the letters used, and you can think afterwards about what the author might have had in mind.</p>
<p>For example I write <em>epepe</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I might mean exactly that</p></li>
<li>maybe I meant <em>lle</em>, ship it off through two links, to be processed</li>
<li>could I have intended <em>ehh</em>, process it, and then ship it through two links</li>
<li><p>maybe I meant leh, ship it to be processed and sent back!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you meant one of those things you could use words to say so!</p>
<p>This grammar is simple, but it is ambiguous!</p>
<p>That models communications very closely; you can build a means of communication, and learn that it can be described and even used in ways you did not anticipate.</p>
<p>We have just learned the entire language <strong>PEPE</strong>. You might rather call it <strong>EPEP</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are ready for meaning call for <strong>HELP</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="operating-a-system-built-with-pepe">Operating a System built with PEPE</h1>
<p>There seems to be a lack of responsibility so far; who sees that all these pushes and pulls are synchronized!</p>
<p>That is up to the operator, and we will devise a new language, not quite so complex,</p>
<p>which will be called ACAC, although some will prefer the name CACA.</p>
<h1 id="building-an-actural-system-from-a-plan-in-pepe">Building an actural system from a plan in PEPE</h1>
<p>You do not need a plan, just hand the builder a <strong>p</strong> of an <strong>e</strong> to start, along with enough supplies.</p>
<p>Plumbers are very experienced in similar networks, using pipes and couplings. Of course there are other details, like the size of components, and the relationship to the environment where the system will go.</p>
<p>Communications networks often cross roads, rivers, oceans, and exist in outer space, but they all use versions pf the components discussed.</p>
