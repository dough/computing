<p>Communications Languages</p>
<p>Four simple concepts called <strong>Push,Pipe,Pull,Pump</strong> describe communicating. You can <em>push</em> information in, and expect it to be <em>pull</em>ed out; or you can deal with information that has been <em>push</em>ed into a <strong>Pipe</strong>, and expect it to be <em>pull</em>ed out. Thus <strong>Pipe</strong> will model storage, and <strong>Push</strong> will model getting information to it.</p>
<p>Now that we have a notion of how information could get into a system, we think about getting it out by a <strong>Pull</strong> (from storage or from upstream, that is from a Push or a Pipe), preparatory to sending it along, or we could use a <strong>Pump</strong> to pull it in, do something with it, and then push it out.</p>
<p>Doing a small bit of thinking about those four ideas we notice that one, the <strong>Pipe</strong>, is fully <em>passive</em>, some other component will have to be responsible for moving the information, while another, the <strong>Pump</strong>, is fully <em>active</em>, having total responsibility for the information. The other two components, the <strong>Push</strong> and the <strong>Pull</strong>, are really just to extend the reach of the first two, and can be viewed conceptually as made from them.</p>
<p>A Push looks like a Pull followed by a Pump (except that it does not have a motive force inside) and a Pull looks like a Pump followed by a Pipe (except for the lack of a motive force inside).</p>
<p>This tells us that we are only going to need pumps and pipes to build a system, and then think about which parts will be active and which passive when thinking about operating the network. Before devising a <strong>Build</strong> language, which surely will be very complex, one more step might HELP: list the components in the right order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pus<strong>h</strong></li>
<li>Pip<strong>e</strong></li>
<li>Pul<strong>l</strong></li>
<li>Pum<strong>p</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ready, remember that to construct a written language you typically give the <em>alphabet</em>, a dictionary of the <em>words</em>, which are a selection of strings from the alphabet, and a <em>grammar</em> which shows the syntax for sentences. It is very complicated.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>alphabet</em> <strong>p</strong>, <strong>e</strong></li>
<li><em>grammar</em> <strong>the letters must alternate</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some phrases</p>
<ul>
<li><em>pep</em></li>
<li><em>epe</em></li>
<li><em>pepe</em></li>
<li><em>epepepe</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Its easy to write a composition of any length:</p>
<ul>
<li>write either <em>p</em> or <em>e</em> and the composition writes itself</li>
<li>until the desired length is reached (or you run out of time, or patience, or letters).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not very hard to use this language, and there are only two sentences of any particular length, determined by the first letter!</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot the <em>dictionary</em>:</p>
<p>There are four words:</p>
<ul>
<li>h spelled ep, meaning you are pushing to someone`</li>
<li>e meaning you will just be used (as a pipe)</li>
<li>l spelled pe, meaning someone is going to pull from you</li>
<li>p, meaning you are going to process something</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not be used to the fact that the grammar is already determined by the letters used, and you can think afterwards about what the author might have had in mind.</p>
<p>For example I write <em>epepe</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I might mean exactly that</p></li>
<li>maybe I meant <em>lle</em></li>
<li><p>could I have intended <em>ehh</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This grammar is simple, but it is ambiguous!</p>
<p>That models communications very closely; you can build a means of communication, and learn that it can be described and even used in ways you did not anticipate.</p>
<p>We have just learned the entire language <strong>PEPE</strong>. You might rather call it <strong>EPEP</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are ready for meaning call for <strong>HELP</strong>.</p>
